# Style_Transfer
Here I have tried a technique called Nueral Style Transfer using which I can transfer a style and texture of an image to other.\
For the I have used a pre-trained model "VGG-19".

# To Run 
1 - You can download the source code and put content image and style image in the resource and mention path of this image in file "transfer.py" and run the command\
$python transfer.py\
OR\
2 - (Recommended) You can open the file "colab.ipynb" in google colab, upload the content image and style image change image path in the last cell and see the magic.
